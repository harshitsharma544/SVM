# Support Vector Machine (SVM)

This project demonstrates the implementation of the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm for classification using Python and scikit-learn.

---

## Objective

The objective of this project is to understand and apply the Support Vector Machine algorithm to classify data points into different categories.

---

## Tech Stack

- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib  

---

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains structured numerical features along with a target class label.  
The data is split into training and testing sets before model training.

---

## Methodology

1. Load and preprocess the dataset  
2. Perform feature scaling  
3. Split data into training and testing sets  
4. Train the Support Vector Machine classifier  
5. Evaluate model performance  

---

## Model Used

- Support Vector Machine (SVM)

---

## Results

The SVM model provides good accuracy in classifying the dataset.  
Model performance is evaluated using accuracy score.
